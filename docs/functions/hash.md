# hash

Converts a string into a fixed length hexadecimal string.

NOTE: The result is useful for comparison and validation, such as storing and validating a hashed password without exposing the original password.

```javascript
hash(string [, algorithm [, encoding]] [, additionalIterations])
```

```javascript
returns string
```
